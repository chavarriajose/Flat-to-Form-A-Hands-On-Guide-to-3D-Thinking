# Flat to Form: A Hands-On Guide to 3D Thinking
A collection of printable paper templates for constructing Platonic solids and other geometric forms. This repository helps students develop 3D thinking skills by assembling physical models from flat, 2D layouts, making geometry more intuitive and hands-on.

## Platonic Solids
Platonic solids are the fundamental building blocks of three-dimensional geometry. The Platonic solids consist in five shapes: Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, and Icosahedron. They are unique because all their faces are identical, all edges are equal, and all angles are the same. Their perfect symmetry makes them an ideal starting point for understanding spatial relationships and form construction.

By exploring these simple yet powerful structures, we can break down complex 3D forms into their basic components. Mastering these solids provides a strong foundation for thinking in three dimensions, allowing us to create, manipulate, and combine shapes with greater ease and intuition.
